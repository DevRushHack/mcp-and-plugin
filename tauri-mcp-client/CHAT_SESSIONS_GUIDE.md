# FastAPI Chat Sessions - Cursor-like Interface

## Overview

The FastAPI server now includes session management for chat conversations, creating a Cursor-like experience where each query is preserved and displayed in expandable accordions.

## Features

### ðŸŽ¯ Session Management
- **Persistent Sessions**: Each query creates a new session that's saved to disk
- **Session History**: All previous conversations are preserved and accessible
- **Message Threading**: Each session maintains a complete conversation thread

### ðŸŽ¨ Cursor-like UI
- **Query First**: Input field is prominently displayed at the top
- **Accordion Interface**: Each query/response is displayed in expandable cards
- **Expandable Content**: Click to expand/collapse conversation details
- **Message History**: See the full conversation flow for each query

### ðŸ”§ API Endpoints

- `GET /sessions/{session_id}/messages` - Get messages for a specific session
- `DELETE /sessions/{session_id}` - Delete a session
