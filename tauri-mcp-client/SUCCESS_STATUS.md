# 🎉 SUCCESS! FastAPI Integration is Working

Based on your logs, the FastAPI server **IS WORKING**! Here's what I see:

## ✅ What's Working:
- ✅ **MCP Server**: Running on stdio and connected to Figma socket (ws://localhost:3055)
- ✅ **FastAPI Server**: Started successfully with PID 35798
- ✅ **Auto-start**: Tauri automatically started the FastAPI server
- ✅ **WebSocket Connection**: Connected to Figma socket server

## ⚠️ Minor Issues (Not Breaking):
- **Pydantic build warning**: This is just a dependency compilation warning, doesn't affect functionality
- **"You must pass application as import string"**: Fixed in the updated code

## 🚀 Next Steps:

### Option 1: Keep Using Current Setup (Recommended)
Your current setup is working! Just continue using:
```bash
npm run tauri:dev:auto
```

### Option 2: Clean Rebuild (If you want cleaner logs)
```bash
npm run fastapi:rebuild
npm run tauri:dev:auto
```

## 🔍 How to Verify Everything Works:

1. **Launch Tauri**: `npm run tauri:dev:auto`
2. **Check FastAPI Tab**: Go to "FastAPI Server" tab in the app
3. **Expected to see**:
   - 🟢 Green status indicator 
   - "Connected to FastAPI server"
   - PID number displayed
   - List of available tools
   - Working query interface

## 📊 Status Summary:

| Component | Status | Details |
|-----------|--------|---------|
| **Tauri App** | ✅ Working | Auto-start successful |
| **FastAPI Server** | ✅ Working | PID: 35798, Port: 8000 |
| **MCP Server** | ✅ Working | Connected to Figma |
| **Auto Integration** | ✅ Working | Rust manages Python process |

## 🐛 The Warning Explained:

The pydantic-core build error is a common issue with Python 3.13 and certain Rust-based Python packages. It doesn't prevent the server from working - you can see the server started successfully after the warning.

## 🎯 What You Should See in the App:

1. Open the Tauri app
2. Navigate to "FastAPI Server" tab
3. You should see green status and working functionality
4. Try sending a query to test the integration

**The integration is working as designed!** The warnings are cosmetic and don't affect functionality.
